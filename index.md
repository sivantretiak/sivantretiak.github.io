## About Me

Hello! I am a third-year math PhD student at The Ohio State Universtiy, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Pooya Hatami](https://pooyahatami.org). My current work is in theoretical machine learning.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University under the guidance of Prof. [Ron Holzman](https://holzman.technion.ac.il). After graduating, I taught math for two years at [Benjamin Franklin High School](https://www.baltimorecityschools.org/o/bcps/page/239). Go Bayhawks!

My non-academic interests include [boardgames](assets/img/boardgame.jpeg), [poetry](assets/files/poetry.pdf), and [weightlifting](assets/img/turtle_weightlifting.jpeg).
