## About Me

Hello! I am a third-year math PhD student at The Ohio State Universtiy, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor Pooya Hatami. My current work is in theoretical machine learning.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University under the guidance of Professor Ron Holzman. After graduating, I taught math for two years at Benjamin Franklin High School. Go Bayhawks!
